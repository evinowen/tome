**Tome** is an opportunity to add structure and transparency to how you track daily notes and documentation - as a lightweight markdown editor with a minimalist focus, Tome helps keep your attention on the subject at hand.

As files are composed Tome automatically saves updates and changes, tracking these changes through the Git versioning system which enables the choice to revert changes or commit changes to record.  Tome streamlines the commit and push process to ensure commits are delivered to remote storage transparently and securely.
