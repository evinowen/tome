## [Quick Commit Error: Signature](quick-commit-error-signature)

To create a commit git requires a valid signature - this means a name and an e-mail address must be set for the commit process.

This can be done one of two ways, either though the global Settings page - which are stored as part of your `config.json` - or directly
through the Commit page interface.

If a value is set on the Settings page, it will be auto-populated on the Commit page when it is opened. Otherwise, you have the option of
providing these details when you perform your first commit of your active session and they will be retained until the session is ended.
